I am a Software Engineer driven by a strong passion for technology and an enthusiasm for the DevOps culture. I have a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Bergamo, where I graduated with full grades and honors. Currently, I am working at ABB, where I use cloud Azure technologies on a daily basis. I am constantly seeking to learn and explore new trends in technology, and I am excited to continue growing and developing my skills as a Software Engineer.
